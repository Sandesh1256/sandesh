            Hikaru found himself standing at the base of a misty mountain, each step pulling him forward through the cool, damp air. The world around him felt both vivid and surreal, colors melting into one another as if he were walking through a painted dream. Above him, the peak was shrouded in clouds, and from within that haze, a voice called out.
            
            "Hikaru..."<BR>
           <b> Hikarus inner soul whispered:</b>
              "Is she Mizuki’s the girl of my dream ,voice—soft, melodic, and unmistakable. My heartbeat quickened as with a heavy heart,I pushed forward, I feet sinking into the soft earth. The mountain seemed to stretch endlessly, yet I climbed with a desperation .why am i seeing her?. Every breath felt heavy, with every step a question that lingered in the air.Is she real? Or just a figment of my imagination?
              is she with me?"<BR>
                Hikaru: "Mizuki, where are you?" <br>
                Please answer me, I need to know. <br>
                The voice called out again, closer this time. Hikaru's heart raced.<br>
           <B> Hikarus inner soul whispered:</B>> <br> "Hikaru, I'm here. Follow my voice." <br>
           Finally, the mist parted, and there she stood. Mizuki, bathed in a warm, golden glow, her silhouette gentle against the harsh edges of the world around them. She looked at him, her eyes filled with an emotion he couldn’t name. Without a word, Hikaru reached out, his fingers trembling as they touched her fingers.Mizuki then whispered: "I'm here, Hikaru. I've always been here." <br>
            Mizuki's presence enveloped him, her touch to his restless soul.<BR>
            <b>Hikaru</b>: "I missed you, Mizuki. I missed you so much." <br>
            Mizuki: "I know, Hikaru. I missed you too.Since from the last day of school when you expressed your deepest love towards me My heart started to beat for you.your love always created a vaccum in heart .every night with out you was a night mare for me .haikaru,i  love .sorry for alll those days when i couldnot understand your." <br> 
           <B>Hikaru</B> : "I love you, Mizuki. I always have, and I always will." <br>
                She turned, she wrapped her arms around him. Her hug was warm, her heartbeat a gentle thrum against my chest. In that moment, everything felt right. The world fell away, and all that remained was the feeling of her—close, real.
            
            But then, the warmth began to fade. Mizuki's hold loosened, and shadows crept in at the edges of his vision. Her form began to dissolve, like sand slipping through his fingers.
            <br>
            <B>hikaru</B>:I love you,<br>
            wait why are fadding ,please dont go,Mizuki please dont leave me " <br>
            <b>Mizuki</b> "I'm sorry H   I  K  A    R    U  ..........<br>
            "No.no n o n oo n  ooo.. Mizuki, M I Z U K I!" i cried out, but my voice was swallowed by the encroaching darkness.
            
            And then—<br>
            <b>Hikaru</b> : "M I Z U K I! huff uff ....why is my heart pumping so deep? Why does her dream linger in my eyes? why this hand always search for her? can i ever get her back ,damm this cannot be true not in this life ,the day i expressed my love to her was the last day of my life with her ,i dont know your emptyness in my heart can ever be filled,no matters this life or next life i will always love you Mizuki " <br>
            Hikaru jolted awake, his body drenched in cold sweat. His breathing was ragged, his chest tight with a pain that lingered beyond the dream. The room around him was dim, the early morning light peeking through the curtains. But even in the quiet safety of his room, the ghost of that embrace haunted him, a reminder of the love that remained just out of reach.
            
            <h2><center><u>Chapter 2: Is this a coincidence</u></center></h2><br>
            
            (The day of the exam results arrived. Students crowded around the notice board, their voices a mix of excitement and anxiety. Hikaru stood at the edge of the crowd, his expression calm, almost detached. He knew the outcome before he even looked.
            
            When the results were posted, his name sat at the very top. Once again, he had outperformed everyone, the label of 'genius' draped over him like a cloak he could never shed. His friends congratulated him, their voices muffled, distant. To them, this was another victory for Hikaru. But to him, it was hollow—a crown resting on an empty throne.)<br><br>
            
            His success was nothing more than a bandage over a wound that refused to heal. No achievement could fill the void left by Mizuki. No accomplishment could silence the whisper of her name in his mind.
            
            In his soul, he felt adrift. Surrounded by applause, yet utterly alone.<br><br>
            
            <b>hikaru</b>:"Mizuki, where are you? none achivement is worth without you if not you no other ,the rest of my life is in the sweetest memory of you ,the you were into my arm closest to my heart ,my heart is your ."<br>
            <br>
            (no longer the time passed without any problem ,he entered the his new collage)<br><br>
            The campus buzzed with new beginnings. Fresh faces, hopeful smiles, the air thick with the promise of futures yet to unfold. Hikaru walked through the gates, his steps slow, almost reluctant. His mind was elsewhere, in the shadowy corners of his past, where Mizuki’s voice still echoed.
            walking through the campus, he felt a strange sense .<br><br>
            what is this feeling?where is this pleasent smell comming from? i know ,its her ,not even in a thousand year would even for her?i she here ?why is her voice romming my ears.is this a dream,not its not so is it real can she be here<br> 
              <B>His soul whispered</B>, "What a beautiful, gruesome smell... I know this scent. Is this... her?"<br><br>
              "no nooo ""
              no what am i even thinking of i have to move on but... this voice ,its familiar"<br><br>
              A gust of wind brushed past him, carrying with it a fragrance so familiar it made his chest ache. His heart thudded heavily, a drumbeat against his ribs. He turned, his eyes searching the sea of strangers.<br><br>
            
              "Why is my heart pumping so deep? Why does her dream linger in my eyes? Why is she still running through my mind?"<br><br>
              
              His thoughts spiraled, each one drawing him closer to an invisible thread that bound him to her. And then, as if the universe had answered his silent plea, he saw her.<br>
  
             frustated with his thoughts he covers his ears and closed his eyes but .   when he opened his eyes , sees her walking ahead with her charm .<br><br>
                Mizuki,your face as of moon is still tears my heart appart, a her hair a as the flow of river, her eyes as the deepest ocean still sinks me inside her, her cheek is of a child feels so lovely ,her voice of  nightingale and her smile always melts my heart warm.<br><br.
                is this even true,Mizuki turned, her gaze meeting his. For a moment, time stood still. And then, a smile tugged at the corners of her lips, a smile that held the happiness of a thousand tomorrows.<br><br>
                Hikaru's soul quivered, caught between the hope of a new beginning and the pain of an unanswered confession.<br><br>
             His soul quivered, caught between the hope of a new beginning and the pain of an unanswered confession.</p>
